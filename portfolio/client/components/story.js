As human-beings, passions are what drives our decisions. As a kid, I used to think about
what I was going to be when I grew up. I would think about cool people that had jobs doing
the things that I loved to do and try to set up my future. My interests at the time were
building Legos and being outside at the beautiful beaches of Southern California. Over
time, I had to give up on the first one :( , but I was excited to make a career out of
proteting the natural environment that I enjoyed so much.`,
`After graduating from Oregon State University with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences
(with an emphasis in Water Resources), I was determined to become an engineer. Over the next year,
I used free material on YouTube to teach myself subjects like Physics, Calculus, and industry-related
mathematics in order to take the California Fundementals of Engineering exam. The early mornings and
sleepless nights paid off, though; I passed on the first attempt and was ready to become an engineer.
`,
`There was a problem: I was unhappy. In the 5 years that led up to this point, I had sacrificed life
experiences for studying and grinding. I had not had the chance to experience life and get to know myself.
How was I supposed to feel a sense of purpose in this world if I didn't even know who I was? I decided that
it was time to take some time away from my professional aspirations and figure out who I was and what I wanted.

`I quit my job.`,
`I packed up my stuff`,
`I bought a one-way ticket to Peru.`,
`Over the next 2 years, I would travel to 11 countries and learned alot: how to speak 2 new languages fluently,
the feeling of standing on a mountain summit with nobody around, the subtleties of Calena salsa dancing, how
your shins feel after 4 months of training Muay Thai everyday in Thailand (PAIN!)... I could go on and on,
but the memories far surpass the amount of space on this page. I felt connected with myself and more importantly,
I was ready to build something for myself. WHat that 'something' was, I was not sure.
`,
`I came back to career where I started learning Python. I loved the logic used for creating data flows and that I could
process thousands of data points with a single function call. I couldn't stop learning.
